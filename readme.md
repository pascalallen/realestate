##The Lead-in

Prioritize the following list according to how you develop applications/websites and explain why you chose the order you did:

- Separation of concerns: This is #1 because I prefer to go over the complexity (features, scalability, logic) prior to writing code. It's important to know your limits, you do not want to sell yourself short and you do not want to bite off more than you can chew. If you're able to put the concerns behind you first and foremost then you are ready to begin.
- Rapid development: This is #2 because you want to be able to reach your development milestones at the predesignated deadlines. In a perfect world every deadline would be met but this is not always the case when developing. You can run into bugs, features can change (per clients request), etc. 
- Application/Site performance: This is #3 because the application should work as expected per the clients requirements and there should be no bugs or errors.
- Maintainability: This is #4 because I typically design applications so that they do not require maintenance or they are delivered to the client. Although this could be higher up on the list if you are designing an application that you will be maintaining or will need to add on to in the future.

##Analytical Skills

Provide an example of an existing high traffic web application that you think provides excellent usability for the user. Please provide your thoughts and analysis on why you believe it demonstrates excellent usability.

- Facebook: Although I am not a Facebook user, I have used it in the past and it is a great example regarding the topic above. It has 2 billion users and rarely any issues with security, speed, and UI/UX. You're able to quickly jump to any users profile by clicking on their name or avatar from anywhere within the page. It plays videos seamlessly on the fly as you are scrolling down your timeline. You can store hundreds of videos and pictures. The application is uniform, probably because it utilizes ReactJS which makes everything modular using "components". Since they use ReactJS they are able to reuse lots of their front end code.
